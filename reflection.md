# Chiashi Yang - Overall, this assignment was decent. My group and I definitely struggled for a bit. However, after attending tutoring, we were able to figure things out. Through this assignment, we learned how to use Git and the commands. That part went very well. Everything else was quite challenging for us. It took a while for our group to figure out how to modify the code, specifically how to use "Self." I would suggest future students to start this assignment early and to ask for help when needed. Do not procrastinate! It is better to start on it early, so you have time to ask for help. 

# Kiara Singh - This assignment went relatively well. I found that initially my group and I found it a litte hard to correctly plan out and implement the code, however, we were able to eventually figure out some of the main issues. For instance, at firts we were a little confused as to how to properly use Git and all the different commands, but after practicing with the different commands we were able to collaborate efficiently. I also found that it took me a while to understand the uses of object, methods, and attributes. Although, through this assignment I was able to learn about the concepts of each one and why they are useful in programming. I would reccomend that students start this early and use resources such as tutoring because it can help make the process feel less stressful.
