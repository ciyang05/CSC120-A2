# Chiashi Yang - Overall, this assignment was decent. My group and I definitely struggled for a bit. However, after attending tutoring, we were able to figure things out. Through this assignment, we learned how to use Git and the commands. That part went very well. Everything else was quite challenging for us. It took a while for our group to figure out how to modify the code, specifically how to use "Self." I would suggest future students to start this assignment early and to ask for help when needed. Do not procrastinate! It is better to start on it early, so you have time to ask for help.
